# Development Challenge - Refactor

This challenge allows you to demonstrate your ability to understand existing code and improve it for the sake of read-ability and modularity.   

* Please [refactor](http://www.refactoring.com) the provided example (GenerateVCS.asp).
* Please provide a summary, commenting on what was refactored and why (for this, create new file called `changes.md`).
* Polish your code as much as possible, use: comments, clear variable names, etc.

The output should not change for a given input, just modify the code used to generate that output.
